INSERT INTO `cards` VALUES (1,'The Fool','The Fool is a card of fresh starts and possibilities. You are starting your adventure, standing at the edge of the cliff, about to take your first step into the unknown, much like the young man. No matter how absurd this leap of faith may appear to you, you are being called to dedicate yourself and follow your heart even though you are not precisely sure where you are heading. You need to have faith in the direction the universe is leading you right now.','Beginnings, innocence, spontaneity, a free spirit'),(2,'The Magician','The Magician, a master manifestor, provides you with the resources, energy, and tools you require to realize your dreams. Seriously, you have access to whatever you require right now. You have the resources to make your desires come true in the spiritual (fire), physical (earth), mental (air), and emotional (water) realms. You will develop into a manifestation powerhouse when you combine them with the power of the spiritual and physical realms. The secret is to combine these technologies in a way that has a higher impact than the sum of their individual effects.','Manifestation, resourcefulness, power, inspired action'),(3,'The High Priestess','-	The High Priestess is the protector of the subconscious mind and a teacher of holy wisdom and hidden mysteries, whereas The Magician is the defender of the conscious mind and the material world. The High Priestess, who resides at the juncture of the conscious and subconscious mind, has an intrinsic ability to seamlessly transition between both worlds. She teaches you that deeper forces are frequently at work and that things are not always as they seem. She guides you through the flimsy curtain of consciousness, giving you a profound, intuitive comprehension of the Universe and a heightened sensitivity to unspoken or hidden knowledge.','Intuition, sacred knowledge, divine feminine, the subconscious mind'),(4,'The Empress','-	The Empress represents a close affinity with our femininity. Femininity, which can be expressed in a variety of ways such as elegance, sensuality, fertility, creative expression, and nurturing, is essential for achieving balance in both men and women. You are encouraged to connect with your feminine spirit by the Empress. Make your life beautiful. Taste, touch, sound, smell, and sight can help you to connect with your senses. Use these senses to feel pleasure and profound fulfillment. Spend more time with your partner, go to a day spa, learn how to massage people, dine at a great restaurant. Learn many methods for creative expression, whether it is through drama, music, painting, or other art forms. This could be the ideal time to start a new interest that gives you access to this side of yourself.','Femininity, beauty, nature, nurturing, abundance'),(5,'The Emperor','-	The Emperor stands for a strong leader who demands allegiance and control. You value recognition, status, and power, and you feel most at ease in a leadership position where you can order people around. You exercise fair but firm authority as a leader. You organize those around you to help you realize your vision because you have a clear idea of what you want to achieve. You take suggestions from others into consideration, yet you still like to be in charge. You are not intimidated by conflict, and you won\'t think twice about using your authority to defend the people you care about. And those people will give you the devotion and respect you deserve in return. Be a leader and an influencer and assert your authority.','Authority, establishment, structure, a father figure'),(6,'The Hierophant','-	The Hierophant card is commonly associated with religion and other formal systems since it stands for a well-established system of spiritual principles and values. The Hierophant advises you to study the fundamentals from a reliable source before you can establish your own belief systems and make your own decisions','Spiritual wisdom, religious beliefs, conformity, tradition,institutions'),(7,'The Lovers','-	The Lovers card, in its most basic form, stands for meaningful ties and aware connections. When this card appears in a Tarot reading, it signifies that you have a lovely, soul-honoring relationship with a loved one. The sexual energy between you two may transcend much beyond mere fulfillment and lust to something that is incredibly spiritual and almost Tantric, leading you to believe that you have found your soul mate or life partner. The Lovers card can suggest a close friendship or family relationship where love, respect, and compassion are present even though it usually denotes a romantic partnership.','Love, harmony, relationships, values alignment, choices'),(8,'The Chariot','-	The Chariot is a card symbolizing strength, will, and resolve. With the help of the Lovers card, you have learned how to make choices that are consistent with your ideals, and you are now acting on those choices. The Chariot is a symbol of encouragement when it comes in a Tarot reading. You have set your goals and are working tirelessly to achieve them by drawing on your inner strength. You will be successful if you use discipline, commitment, and willpower to accomplish your goals.','Control, willpower, success, action, determination'),(9,'Strength','-	Similar to The Chariot, The Strength card denotes fortitude, power, and strength. The Power card, on the other hand, speaks to the inner strength and the human spirit\'s capacity to overcome any obstacle, whilst The Chariot represents physical strength and will. Strength is the confidence that you can overcome the challenges of life. With underlying patience and inner calmness, your strength and persistence are well matched. You are determined to do what has to be done, and the manner you approach it demonstrates your maturity and composure.','Strength, courage, persuasion, influence, compassion'),(10,'The Hermit','-	The hermit signifies that you are taking a vacation from your regular activities in order to focus your attention and energy inside and discover the answers you seek in the depths of your soul. You come to understand that your deepest sense of truth and wisdom lies within yourself, not in the surrounding distractions. You leave the ordinary behind and go on a voyage of self-discovery, following only your inner guidance and knowledge. Now is the ideal moment to embark on a weekend retreat or holy trip, anything that will allow you to reflect on your objectives, individual beliefs, and guiding principles, and draw nearer to your true self.','Soul-searching, introspection, being alone, inner guidance'),(11,'Wheel of Fortune','-	The Wheel of Fortune serves as a constant reminder that life is an ever-changing wheel. If you\'re going through a challenging moment, know that things will get better. In due course, good fortune and luck will reappear. Similarly, if everything is going well, realize that this too may change and that life may soon return to \"normal.\" This cycle demonstrates the value of cherishing your happy moments and making the most of them while they are still present because they could vanish in an instant.','Good luck, karma, life cycles, destiny, a turning point'),(12,'Justice','-	The Justice card stands for law, fairness, justice, and truth. You are being held accountable for your deeds and will face the consequences. You don\'t need to be concerned if your actions were in line with your Higher Self and were done for the benefit of others. If not, you will be called out and forced to take responsibility for your actions. If you\'re shivering in your boots about this, remember that the Justice card isn\'t as clear-cut as you may believe. Although you may have done something you regret, this card says that you will be handled fairly and without prejudice. Justice is accompanied by a sense of compassion and understanding. Be prepared to own up to your mistakes and take a stand.','Justice, fairness, truth, cause and effect, law'),(13,'The Hanged Man','-	The Hanged Man serves as a reminder that sometimes you have to put everything on hold before you can go forward, or else the Universe will take action for you (and not always when it\'s convenient!). The adage \"What got you here won\'t get you there\" may have crossed your mind, and with this card, it definitely applies. In order to perceive your environment from a new perspective and take advantage of new opportunities that would have otherwise been hidden from you if you hadn\'t applied the breaks, the Hanged Man asks you to let go of the outdated mental models and behavioral habits that no longer serve you.',' Pause, surrender, letting go, new perspectives'),(14,'Death','-	The Death card represents the conclusion of a significant stage or element of your life that you understand is no longer beneficial to you, creating space for something far more significant and important. To open another door, the first one must be shut. You must leave the past behind and part ways, prepared to seize fresh chances and opportunities. Although it could be difficult at first, you will quickly realize how important it is and how it holds the potential for regeneration and change. You may feel pain physically and emotionally if you refuse to accept these essential endings, but if you use your imagination to picture a different scenario, you enable more positive patterns to emerge.','Endings, change, transformation, transition'),(15,'Temperance','-	This card encourages you to maintain your composure even in the face of stress or adversity. Keep your emotions in check and maintain a level temperament. You\'ve mastered the ability to maintain composure under pressure. Little things don\'t bother you, because you seem to have an endless supply of patience. You will attain and feel life fulfillment as a result of your respect for harmony and peace.','Balance, moderation, patience, purpose'),(16,'The Devil','-	The Devil card stands for your darker side, as well as the restrictions and factors that prevent you from becoming your best self. Negative behaviors, dependencies, cognitive patterns, relationships, and addictions can be having an impact on you. You have discovered that you are caught between the immediate pleasure you experience and the long-term suffering you go through. The Devil is a card that speaks to duality and choice in a similar way to the Lovers card, with the exception that when you choose The Devil, you are doing so at the risk of your long-term wellbeing. You have essentially sold your soul to the devil!','Shadow self, attachment, addiction, restriction, sexuality'),(17,'The Tower','-	Expect the unexpected, including significant change, upheaval, devastation, and turmoil, when The Tower card comes in a Tarot reading. It could be a divorce, a loved one\'s passing, financial ruin, health issues, a natural disaster, a job loss, or any other traumatic experience that leaves you feeling physically, intellectually, and spiritually shaken. You cannot avoid it. Change is here to upend everything, bring turmoil, and destroy everything in its path, but trust me, it\'s all for the best.','Sudden change, upheaval, chaos, revelation, awakening'),(18,'The Star','-	Following a time of devastation and upheaval, The Star, which appears after The Tower in the Tarot, is a welcome relief. You have overcome numerous obstacles and freed yourself of all restrictive thoughts that had previously restricted you. You are beginning to understand who you truly are at your heart, beneath all the layers. You are aware that you are always connected to the Divine and pure loving energy, regardless of what life throws at you. You possess a fresh understanding of who you are and how fundamentally important you are.','Hope, faith, purpose, renewal, spirituality'),(19,'The Moon','-	The Moon generally appears when you are projecting dread into the present and the future based on your past experiences. The Moon represents your anxieties and illusions. You may have experienced emotional anguish as a result of a traumatic memory, and instead of dealing with the feelings, you repressed them deep within your subconscious. These feelings are now resurfacing, and you can find yourself influenced by them on a conscious or subconscious level.','Illusion, fear, anxiety, subconscious, intuition'),(20,'The Sun','-	The Sun stands for achievement, brilliance, and abundance. The Sun offers you courage and assures you that your radiant, upbeat energy will accompany you everywhere you go and bring you happiness and joy no matter what you do. You attract others because you always look on the bright side and add so much warmth to their life. What will help you achieve and get you through the difficult times is this lovely, loving energy. Additionally, you are in a position to share with people your best traits and accomplishments. Shine your affection on those you care about and radiate who you are and what you stand for.','Positivity, fun, warmth, success, vitality'),(21,'Judgement','-	You are being called by the Judgement card to evolve and embrace a higher state of consciousness in order to serve your highest good. You are having a spiritual awakening and becoming aware of your true purpose. This is your cosmological advancement! When the call comes, you are prepared to answer. Pay attention to a louder frequency. Step into this fresh iteration of who you truly are and let go of the old you.','Judgement, rebirth, inner calling, absolution'),(22,'The World','-	When the World card emerges in a Tarot reading, you are beaming with satisfaction and a sense of accomplishment. You are currently savoring the sensation of completion and success after a lengthy project, study time, romantic connection, or professional endeavor has reached its conclusion. This card could signify completing school, getting married, having a child, or realizing a long-held ambition. Finally, you\'ve fulfilled your intention or mission. Everything has come together, and you are in the right situation, acting appropriately, and realizing your goals. You have a sense of completeness.','Completion, integration, accomplishment, travel'),(23,'Ace of Cups','-	The best time to feel the abundant flow of emotion that is currently available to you is right now. You are more open to imaginative possibilities, meaningful relationships, and profound compassion for other living things. This card represents an invitation, as are all Aces in the Tarot. Would you accept it? Will you accept the love and compassion of the Divine and follow it? Only if you accept the Ace of Cups with an open heart does it hold the promise for spiritual and emotional fulfillment.','Love, new relationships, compassion, creativity.'),(24,'Two of Cups','-	The flow of love between two individuals is represented by the Two of Cups, while the Ace of Cups symbolizes the flow of love from inside. With the help of this card, you are forging strong bonds and alliances based on compassion, unconditional love, and similar beliefs. Even if these connections are still in their infancy, they have the potential to mature and evolve over time into something profoundly fulfilling and rewarding. Together, you ascend to higher levels of consciousness and comprehension because you respect and value one another.','Unified love, partnership, mutual attraction'),(25,'Three of Cups','-	You are urged to get together with your closest friends and have a nice time, talking, laughing, sharing, and creating, when the Three of Cups occurs in a Tarot reading. You provide and receive from one another the love, reassurance, and compassion that each of you needs. You might feel motivated to organize a night out, a weekend getaway, or a circle to work with others who share your interests. You\'re all here to accomplish incredible things together, and the energy is strong.','Celebration, friendship, creativity, collaborations.'),(26,'Four of Cups','-	New invitations and opportunities are coming your way when the Four of Cups appears in a Tarot reading, but for the time being, you\'re saying \"no\" and declining them. Maybe you are not interested in the possibilities, your cup is already full, or you already have too much on your plate. Decide what is actually important to you using your discernment, and don\'t be hesitant to reject new ventures that don\'t fit with your long-term goals.','Meditation, contemplation, apathy, reevaluation.'),(27,'Five of Cups','-	When things don\'t go as planned and you\'re sad, regretful, and disappointed, the Five of Cups frequently emerges in a Tarot reading. You\'ve decided to dwell in your misery rather than go on with your life. At this point, all you can think about is what went wrong and how you failed. It\'s time to move on, sweetheart! Feel the emotions, sure, but give yourself a defined amount of time to wallow in self-pity before getting yourself together and moving on.','Regret, failure, disappointment, pessimism.'),(28,'Six of Cups','-	The Six of Cups is a card that brings back pleasant memories from your past, whether they were from when you were a child, adolescent, or a young adult. You can simply be going through those memories in your head, or you might go back to the place where you grew up or get in touch with old pals. Attend a high school reunion or get in touch with an old friend. A former love interest or high school sweetheart could resurface. As you think back on all the good times you shared, these connections make you feel joyful and content. Use this opportunity to determine whether you still share a lot of interests and whether you want to move forward with the relationship.','Revisiting the past, childhood memories, innocence, joy.'),(29,'Seven of Cups','-	The Seven of Cups is a card of fresh starts, options, and occasionally deception. When the Seven of Cups occurs in a Tarot reading, you have a wide range of choices and opportunities. But take caution! You are prone to delusion and irrational expectations. An opportunity that promises more money, more fame, or more power may seem alluring, but as you investigate it further, you may find that it isn\'t everything it seems to be. Your ego could lead you in a certain way, but it\'s crucial that you first consult your Higher Self. Consider your alternatives carefully and delve deeper to learn the implications of each decision.','Opportunities, choices, wishful thinking, illusion.'),(30,'Eight of Cups','-	When the Eight of Cups appears in a Tarot reading, you might feel obliged to leave an unsatisfactory circumstance. It can entail giving up a relationship, job, career path, housing situation, or artistic endeavor that once brought you immense joy but is now only causing you suffering. Despite your best efforts, you feel disappointed since you are emotionally involved in the scenario but it didn\'t turn out the way you had hoped, and you realize that you are no longer benefiting from it. Now, the only option is to move past it and carry on with your life, even though saying goodbye makes you sad.','Disappointment, abandonment, withdrawal, escapism.'),(31,'Nine of Cups','-	The Nine of Cups represents a call to indulge, splurge, and take pleasure in life. This involves taking pleasure in fine cuisine and wine, admiring the arts, making love, unwinding in an opulent resort, or taking in beauty. Live in the now and allow yourself to temporarily enjoy without feeling guilty about the potential drawbacks of such pleasure.','Contentment, satisfaction, gratitude, wish come true.'),(32,'Ten of Cups','-	The Ten of Cups represents emotional contentment, happiness, and joy, especially in your relationships and family. Your life is full of love and happiness that you have created, and as you spread this love to others, your heart becomes even bigger. This card frequently emerges when you are surrounded by the people you love and have a strong bond with. Together, you assist each other realize your full potential by showing each other appreciation and support. You get such joy when you observe your family members prospering and enjoying their life.','Divine love, blissful relationships, harmony, alignment.'),(33,'Page of Cups','-	The Page of Cups portends an unexpected fresh thought or chance for you. Now that your creative energy is flowing, decide how you will use it. Will you seize this fresh concept and make it happen, or will you allow someone else to do it? You are in control! Spend some time considering the concept to choose whether you want to proceed.',' Creative opportunities, intuitive messages, curiosity, possibility.'),(34,'Knight of Cups','-	When the Knight of Cups occurs in a Tarot reading, you are motivated by the many artistic avenues at your disposal and thrive on all things lovely. It is action-oriented. You\'ve daydreamed about what you want to create, and now you\'re taking action to turn that goal into reality. Based on your feelings, imagination, and intuition, it can be an artistic endeavor or something you feel \"called\" to do. Be willing to investigate your interests and innovative concepts.','Creativity, romance, charm, imagination, beauty.'),(35,'Queen of Cups','-	The Queen of Cups is sympathetic, sensitive, nurturing, and kind. You are assuming her \"nurturing mother\" energy when you see her in a Tarot reading. By giving them your full attention, showing them compassion, and showing them how much you care, you may help others. You are intuitive and can tune in to your gut instinct to detect the needs of others. You also hold the space for people to express their emotions and be their most genuine selves. You have mastered this to the point that, although holding room for emotional expression, you do not absorb the energy or emotional problems of others because you are grounded and are aware of when to establish a healthy separation.',' Compassionate, caring, emotionally stable, intuitive, in flow.'),(36,'King of Cups','-	The King of Cups stands for control over the unconscious, creative, and emotional worlds. When this card appears in a Tarot reading, it means that you have regained control over your emotions and can accept them without letting them rule your life. Even when faced with unexpected obstacles, you can rely on your emotional stability and maturity to get through them. You avoid the drama and don\'t let it affect you; instead, you adopt a level-headed and composed attitude.','Emotionally balanced, compassionate, diplomatic.'),(37,'Ace of Swords','-	An intellectual renaissance is heralded by the Ace of Swords. You might be about to make an important discovery or adopt a fresh way of thinking that will help you see the world clearly. Or, you can suddenly come to terms with or become cognizant of a problem that has been bothering you and be able to see the way forward. To maximize this cerebral capacity and quiet the mind chatter, practice regular meditation.',' Breakthroughs, new ideas, mental clarity, success'),(38,'Two of Swords','-	The Two of Swords suggests that you must make a difficult choice but are unsure of your best course of action. If both options look equally good or unpleasant, you may be perplexed about which will result in the best situation. You must be able to carefully consider the advantages and disadvantages of each option before making a decision. Choose the route that is most in line with your Higher Self by using both your head (your reason and intellect) and your heart (your instincts and intuition).','Difficult decisions, weighing up options, an impasse, avoidance'),(39,'Three of Swords','-	The Three of Swords indicates that you are feeling extremely upset and disappointed when it appears in a Tarot reading. Others\' hurtful words, deeds, and intentions have pierced your heart, causing you to experience strong feelings of sorrow, sadness, grief, and heartbreak. These occurrences are frequently unanticipated and unplanned, which makes them considerably more distressing.','Heartbreak, emotional pain, sorrow, grief, hurt'),(40,'Four of Swords','-	You should take a break before tackling the following obstacle, the Four of Swords advice. You\'ve accomplished a significant first step; now, you must refuel so that you are rested and prepared for the next phase. Take time away from your hectic schedule to recharge your batteries and heal your body and mind, even if you are extremely motivated and productive. Even the toughest and most tenacious people can be broken by constant stress and strain, but brief rest breaks allow you to recharge your energy, concentration, and focus so you are prepared for the next task.','Rest, relaxation, meditation, contemplation, recuperation'),(41,'Five of Swords','-	When you have had a falling out, argument, or quarrel and are leaving with a sense of melancholy and loss, the Five of Swords will appear. You can feel angry and resentful about the abrasive remarks you made and wish you could take back. Your relationships have soured, and there is a feeling of \"bad blood\" and general \"ickiness.\"','Conflict, disagreements, competition, defeat, winning at all costs'),(42,'Six of Swords','-	The Six of Swords indicates that you are in the midst of a change, moving away from the known and toward the unknown. You can be changing professions, moving, ending a relationship, going through a rite of passage, or going through a mental transformation. You may have chosen this shift or it may have been forced upon you, and it may make you feel sad to leave behind something you are so used to. However, you are aware of how important this decision is to your progress and personal development. Increased mental clarity and a newfound acceptance of change will soon take the place of the sadness over what you have lost (or surrendered). As a result, you will improve as a person.','Transition, change, rite of passage, releasing baggage.'),(43,'Seven of Swords','-	The Seven of Swords traditionally represents stealing, betrayal, deception, and trickery. You might be trying to get away with something and moving stealthily behind people\'s backs in an effort to avoid being seen. If you\'re fortunate, you could manage to keep your identity a secret. However, if you\'re unlucky, others will quickly learn what you\'ve done, bringing disgrace and embarrassment upon you. Remember that you run the risk of being exposed if you employ cunning or trickery to gain the upper hand over someone or anything. Even if you aren\'t, the cover-up will take a lot of work, and it might not be worthwhile.','Betrayal, deception, getting away with something, acting strategically'),(44,'Eight of Swords','-	Your current situation makes you feel constrained and stuck, according to the Eight of Swords. You think you have few options and no obvious way out. You can be in an unfulfilling career, an abusive relationship, a circumstance that is out of sync with your inner self, or you might have a sizable debt load. Now there is no way out; you are caught between a rock and a hard place. The woman in the card is somewhat entrapped by the eight swords surrounding her, so take notice that she has some freedom of movement. She only needs to take off the blindfold to let go of the restrictions she has placed on herself.','Negative thoughts, self-imposed restriction, imprisonment, victim mentality'),(45,'Nine of Swords','-	The Nine of Swords indicates that you are feeling depressed and plagued by negative thoughts (and keeping you up at night). You are tense and anxious because you are overly concerned about a scenario and your negative thoughts are controlling you. Your fears will have more control over your life the more you associate with them. The more you focus on what isn\'t working, the more anxious and concerned you\'ll feel. One dreadful idea follows another, and another, and another, until they consume you. It turns into a vicious cycle. Your bad ideas are piled high, much like the nine swords are on the wall.','Anxiety, worry, fear, depression, nightmares'),(46,'Ten of Swords','-	The Ten of Swords denotes a traumatic yet necessary conclusion. For instance, a relationship could end suddenly, your work could be eliminated, or a contract could be breached. It seems as though this conclusion completely out of the blue rocked your existence. It could never have been anticipated, but it has now occurred, shocking you to your core and making you feel as though the world has fallen apart all around you. You are dealing with the agony of this unexpected loss and are unsure of your ability to ever find love, employment, or trust.','Painful endings, deep wounds, betrayal, loss, crisis'),(47,'Page of Swords','-	The Page of Swords is a dynamic, passionate, and enthusiastic person. When this card appears in a Tarot reading, you are brimming over with fresh concepts and future ambitions. A new project, an experiment with a different strategy, or learning something new may inspire you. You feel like you could accomplish anything because you are so energized, and you actually can! The test is whether you can continue, though. Like all Pages, it always starts off promising, but you need something else to continue and maintain the pace.','New ideas, curiosity, thirst for knowledge, new ways of communicating'),(48,'Knight of Swords','-	The Knight of Swords, like the other Knights in the Tarot card, is a man (or woman) on a mission; once he sets his mind to something, nothing can stop him. Additionally, this Knight actively employs the force of his mind to accomplish his objectives as a Swords card.','Ambitious, action-oriented, driven to succeed, fast-thinking'),(49,'Queen of Swords','-	The Queen of Swords blends the maturity and receptiveness of the Queen with the intellectual prowess and mental clarity of the Swords suit. You have the gift of being able to apply your intelligence and objective judgment while being adaptable and receptive to suggestions from other people. You are better equipped to judge situations since you lead from the mind rather than the heart, free from sentimentality or passion. You might think that showing empathy or sympathy for others will take your attention away from the activity at hand. In order to better comprehend individuals and your environment, you would prefer to know the how, what, why, where, when, and who of everything.',' Independent, unbiased judgement, clear boundaries, direct communication'),(50,'King of Swords','-	The King of Swords is a representation of intellectual strength and authority, and he possesses the guts and intelligence necessary to realize all of his goals. When this card occurs in a Tarot reading, you are in control and making decisions from a position of respect and authority. You speak with great conviction and maintain your integrity. People listen to what you have to say as a result.','Mental clarity, intellectual power, authority, truth'),(51,'Ace of Pentacles','-	The Ace of Pentacles signifies fresh starts, possibilities, and potential. These fresh starts pertain to the material realm, including money, success, career, physical health, and goal realization. A new job offer, an unexpected windfall of cash, an opportunity to start a business or make an investment, or the chance to realize an idea are all possibilities. The Ace of Pentacles predicts wealth and abundance in your material or financial life, regardless of the situation. Unquestionably, it is a warm invitation, but it is not a free pass. This card, like all Aces in the Tarot, shows the potential for a new endeavor but does not assure its manifestation or success.','A new financial or career opportunity, manifestation, abundance'),(52,'Two of Pentacles','-	It is safe to assume that when the Two of Pentacles occurs in a Tarot reading, you are juggling your tasks, obligations, and priorities. You might be a parent who works, a general manager of a company, an administrative assistant in a busy workplace, or someone who holds down many jobs, for instance. In the upright position, this card notes that you are doing a great job juggling these various obligations and that you are capable of handling anything life throws at you. However, this Two cautions you that the line between meeting these obligations and losing control is razor-thin. To avoid losing your equilibrium, you must carefully manage your time, energy, and resources.','Multiple priorities, time management, prioritisation, adaptability.'),(53,'Three of Pentacles','-	The Three of Pentacles is a symbol for the usefulness of varying perspectives and levels of expertise when working together. The stonemason values the architects\' wisdom and experience, while the architects respect the stonemason\'s specialized knowledge. Although they have quite diverse backgrounds, levels of experience, and areas of specialty, they can nevertheless work together to share their knowledge in a way that enriches the final output. There is no notion of \"we and them\" or of superiority. Instead, each participant in the project has something to offer and is eager to learn from the others. Together, everyone completes the task and contributes to the group by actively listening and sharing. Recognize the significance of each person as you collaborate on initiatives with others.','Teamwork, collaboration, learning, implementation.'),(54,'Four of Pentacles','-	The Four of Pentacles\' most uplifting interpretation implies that by keeping a firm focus on your objectives and acting responsibly, you have created prosperity and abundance. You actively manage your finances and save money in order to build wealth and lead a good life both now and in the future. You are concerned about your long-term financial security. Consider creating a savings strategy, family budget, retirement plan, and secure investments to safeguard your wealth accumulation and gradually raise your net worth.','Saving money, security, conservatism, scarcity, control.'),(55,'Five of Pentacles','-	The Five of Pentacles represents loss of money and destitution. You\'ve experienced difficult times, particularly in relation to your job, career, cash, and material belongings. It\'s possible that you recently lost your home, employment, or financial stability. You no longer feel secure because everything has been taken from you in a single strike. Since achievement and financial success are frequently correlated, losing either can be a humiliating blow to your self-esteem and feeling of self-worth.

Your words hold a lot of power, particularly the ones you repeat to yourself repeatedly. You can be prone to negative self-talk, limiting beliefs, and self-criticism.

Ask yourself if you would ever say these things to a friend or loved one when you are having negative thoughts, and if the answer is \"hell no,\" then why are you saying these things to yourself?

You could also just write yourself a love letter.','Self-care, unpaid debts, one-sided charity.'),(135,'Seven of Pentacles Reversed','The Seven of Pentacles reversed says that your current efforts may be dispersed and that you are unsure of where you should be allocating your resources.

And be forceful when you refuse to take on tasks you know you cannot complete. You must prioritize your own needs and well-being because if you don\'t, you\'ll burn out and be useless to others.

Since this idea is still very much in its infancy, you don\'t need to do anything just yet. In fact, doing so could be harmful.

Before getting married, you need to consider whether you can manage the family, otherwise your children will suffer from it.','80%'),(72,9,12,'You tend to chime in easily but need to make more efforts to maintain the long relationship. The Sagittarius falls in love quickly but will break up once find you are incompatible; the Pisces, however, will be content once he/she is loved and never think about the long-term issues, thus fall in love confusedly. In the relationship, the Sagittarius can turn around and leave at any time but have no idea on the Pisces’s sacrificing and clingy self-destruction means. So the Sagittarius has to delay and cannot completely break up with Pisces even if have started another relationship, leading to the situation out of control. Never get married out of the momentary thought; instead, you should consider about the future first. Since both of you lack of financial management concept and only care about the present, it will be difficult for you to manage the family well.','40%'),(73,10,10,'You have many same values, respect the ability of one another and support each other in the way needed. Both of you are neither good at expression nor romantic, thus seemingly incompatible. In fact, you have similar personality and can understand and tolerate mutually, so you will encourage each other and be a stable couple once you are determined to be together. For you, the material stability, other people\'s respect and useful insights are very important. Also, you will be of great help for one another at work. Through these methods, you can establish a stable and lasting relationship. You spend the life with tacit understanding; the older you are, the more you love each other.','100%'),(74,10,11,'The Capricorn is under the stubborn earth sign while Aquarius is under the changeable air sign, thus have varied basic ideas. You need to make great efforts to be together. When you are frustrated, the Capricorn may fall in love with Aquarius who is philanthropic and can help when Capricorn is in great need of comfort. After starting the relationship, the Capricorn will find the Aquarius treats everyone like this! The Aquarius might be attracted by Capricorn’s quiet, honest, calm and profound character. But after getting close to the Capricorn will find them are actually experienced, astute and selfish; The Aquarius is not the opponent of Capricorn because he/she often shows his/her inner thoughts clearly due to the short temper while the Capricorn can keep calm, making Aquarius even more angry. Therefore, you two cannot open hearts to each other.','60%'),(75,10,12,'The Pisces is born to be tearful and changeful and has the unstable emotion while the Capricorn is pragmatic and down-to-earth. No matter in making a living or conducting, you are generally suitable for each other. However, it takes a period of time and needs test because the Capricorn is unresponsive to love and has poor initiative; if the Pisces can comply with Capricorn\'s conservative and traditional love essentials to open his/her heart, you will become a firm couple with mutual trust, love and understanding.','80%'),(76,11,11,'In the 12 zodiac signs, Aquarius is the perfect match for you Aquarius people because you can understand the unique and crazy behavior and personality of one another. Also, both of you yearn for freedom, making you even more intimate. Comparing with other lovers, you have the more insipid relationship like the old friends rather than husband and wife but lack of passion. Sometimes, you may tend to have an extramarital affair yet you understand one another and can always stay together. Both of you don\'t know how to manage family finance and you think money is not the most important but stick to your material level required, leading to something out of control.','100%'),(77,11,12,'You are a couple of love and be loved. Aquarius can totally control the Pisces while the Pisces who gives priority to love will completely lose himself/herself in love once he/she falls in love with the rational Aquarius people. Although the Aquarius clearly knows Pisces’s character, he/she always persists the old ways and sticks to the things he/she loves no matter how much the Pisces is hurt; when the Aquarius is needed, he/she accepts Pisces’s considerate care as much as possible but takes it for granted after getting used to his/her care. The strangest thing is that you cannot break up with one another but there is always a wall between you.','60%'),(78,12,12,'Both of you are romantic and sensitive and you clearly know the character of one another, thus very compatible. The emotional change is just like a mirror on each other and you feel it good to know each other well. One of the advantages of your relationship lies in that both of you are unpractical and the imaginative and creative nature promotes you to find the inspirations other cannot get in reality. However, you are overly emotional and can hardly be rational, so you often indulge in your own world regardless of things outside. If you live a peaceful life without great ups and downs, you will be the happiest couple; once you are attacked by the external environment, however, you will have no idea about how to face reality. In addition, you should keep in mind that both of you are too emotional and you need the encouragement and support of one another; as long as you treat each other in the way needed, often open heart to each other and talk about inner fear, you can enjoy the healthy love.','100%');

Why Taurus, of course! Taurus is an earth sign represented by the bull. Like their celestial spirit animal, Taureans enjoy relaxing in serene, bucolic environments surrounded by soft sounds, soothing aromas, and succulent flavors.','April 20','May 20'),(3,'Gemini','Have you ever been so busy that you wished you could clone yourself just to get everything done? That\'s the Gemini experience in a nutshell. Spontaneous, playful, and adorably erratic, Gemini is driven by its insatiable curiosity. Appropriately symbolized by the celestial twins, this air sign was interested in so many pursuits that it had to double itself. You know, NBD!','May 21','June 20'),(4,'Cancer','Represented by the crab, Cancer seamlessly weaves between the sea and shore representing Cancer’s ability to exist in both emotional and material realms.

Virgos are logical, practical, and systematic in their approach to life. Virgo is an earth sign historically represented by the goddess of wheat and agriculture, an association that speaks to Virgo\'s deep-rooted presence in the material world.
